# Bitwise Blast

**Bitwise Blast** is a simple Python **game** based on _binary numbers and bitwise operations_. The game generates a _random binary number_ represented as a string of asterisks (e.g., **\*\*\*\***), and then gives you another random binary number to play with. You can choose a _bitwise operator_ to apply to your number (e.g., &, |, or ^), and then the result will be compared with the secret number, **revealing the bits that match**. If you haven't revealed all the bits yet, you can keep playing with a new random number and operator until you win.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply run the `bitwise_blast.py` script using Python. The game will prompt you to _enter a bitwise operator_ (&, |, or ^) to apply to the player number. After applying the operator, the game will reveal the matching bits between the secret number and the player number. If you haven't revealed all the bits yet, the game will give you a new random number and operator to play with. Keep playing until you reveal all the bits and win!

## Requirements

To run the game, you need to have **Python 3** installed on your system.

## How to Run

To run the game, simply follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
   Navigate to the directory containing the `bitwise_blast.py script`.
2. Run the following command:

`python bitwise_blast.py`
